# Create a Windows Package Manager REST source

This section provides guidance on how to create a REST source for the Windows Package Manager. ISVs or Publishers may host and manage a rest source if they would like full control of the applications available in a source. An independently hosted source may choose to expose the read endpoints publicly or restrict access to specific IP address via the addition of a traffic shaping module.  The basic setups configured by the cmdlets and examples result in a source that is publicly readable but requires an authorization key to manage. 

Windows Package Manager offers a comprehensive package manager solution including a command line tool and a set of services for installing applications. For more general package submission information, see [submit packages to Windows Package Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package/).

There are two ways available for managing REST source repositories with Windows Package Manager:

- [Manage Windows Package Manager REST source with PowerShell](#manage-windows-package-manager-rest-source-with-powershell)
- [Manage Windows Package Manager REST source manually](#manage-windows-package-manager-rest-source-manually)

## Manage Windows Package Manager REST source with PowerShell

To simplify the management and interaction with the Windows Package Manager REST source, the `Microsoft.WinGet.Source` PowerShell module has been made available. This PowerShell module provides cmdlets that enable you to Add, Remove and Get package manifests from your Windows Package Manager REST source, as well as stand up a new Windows Package Manager REST source in Azure.

The following steps are required for managing a Windows Package Manager REST source with PowerShell:

1. Download and install the `Microsoft.WinGet.Source` PowerShell Module.
2. Automate the creation of a Windows Package Manager REST source.
3. Publishing Package Manifests to the Windows Package Manager REST source.
4. Retrieve published Package Manifests from the Windows Package Manager REST source.
5. Remove published Package Manifests from the Windows Package Manager REST source.

### Download and install the PowerShell module

The following steps must be performed before the PowerShell cmdlets are available for use with the Windows Package Manager REST source.

1. Open an Edge Browser.
2. Navigate to [https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli-restsource/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli-restsource/releases).

    ```

### Automate the creation of a Windows Package Manager REST source

The `Microsoft.WinGet.Source` PowerShell module provides the [New-WinGetSource](PowerShell/New-WinGetSource.md) cmdlet to simplify the creation of a Windows Package Manager REST source. This PowerShell cmdlet will initiate a connection to Azure if not currently connected. Validating that the connection is established with a specific Subscription (if specified). Generate the ARM Parameter files with specified values, then create Azure resources with the generated ARM Parameter files and the provided ARM Template files.

The `New-WinGetSource` PowerShell cmdlet makes use of the following input parameters. For more information on how to use this cmdlet, use the `Get-Help New-WinGetSource -Full` or visit the [New-WinGetSource PowerShell Article](PowerShell/New-WinGetSource.md) in Docs.

| Required | Parameter                  | Description                                                                                                                         |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yes      | Name                       | A string of letters which will be prefixed to your newly created Azure resources.                                                   |
| Yes      | ResourceGroup              | The Resource Group that will be used to contain the Azure resources.                                                                |
| No       | SubscriptionName           | The name of the Azure Subscription that will be used to pay for the Azure resources.                                                |
| No       | Region                     | The Azure location where the Azure resources will be created. (Default: westus)                                                     |
| No       | ParameterOutput            | The folder location where the ARM parameter files will be created.                                                                  |
| No       | RestSourcePath             | Path to the compiled REST API Zip file. (Default: \Library\RestAPI\WinGet.RestSource.Functions.zip)                                 |
| No       | ImplementationPerformance  | specifies the performance of the resources to be created for the Windows Package Manager REST source. ["Demo", "Basic", "Enhanced"] |
| No       | ShowConnectionInstructions | If specified, the instructions for connecting to the new Windows Package Manager REST source will be provided. (Default: False)     |

The PowerShell Module must be re-imported each time the PowerShell window is closed. To create a new Windows Package Manager REST source open the Administrative PowerShell Window and run the following:

1. From an Administrative PowerShell window run the following:

    ```PowerShell
    PS C:\> New-WinGetSource -Name "contosorestsource" -ResourceGroup "WinGet" -Region "westus" -ImplementationPerformance "Demo" -ShowConnectionInstructions
    ```

2. After the above command has completed, copy and run the connection information provided for your newly created Windows Package Manager REST source to add to your winget client.

> [!Note]
> To prevent having to re-install this new PowerShell module each time, review the instructions in the [Installing a PowerShell Module on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.compowershell/scripting/developer/module/installing-a-powershell-module?view=powershell-7.1)

### Add manifests to the REST source

The Windows Package Manager REST source provides a location for hosting your Package Manifests. After the creation of your Windows Package Manager REST source has completed, you'll need to add Package Manifests for your users to install from. Using the `Microsoft.WinGet.Source` PowerShell module, the [Add-WinGetManifest](PowerShell/Add-WinGetManifest.md) cmdlet will add new Package Manifests to your Windows Package Manager REST source.

The `Add-WinGetManifest` PowerShell cmdlet supports targeting a specific `*.json` file, or a folder containing `*.yaml` files for a single package manifest. For more information on how to use this cmdlet, use the command: `Get-Help Add-WinGetManifest -Full` or visit the [Add-WinGetManifest article in the PowerShell docs](PowerShell/Add-WinGetManifest.md).

The PowerShell Module must be re-imported each time the PowerShell window is closed. To add an Package Manifest open the Administrative PowerShell Window and run the following:

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Add-WinGetManifest -FunctionName "contoso" -Path "C:\WinGet\Manifests\Windows.PowerToys\1.0.0"
```

## Get manifests from the REST source

The Windows Package Manager REST source provides a location for hosting your Package Manifests. The `Microsoft.WinGet.Source` PowerShell module provides the [Get-WinGetManifest](PowerShell/Get-WinGetManifest.md) cmdlet that will use ManifestGET against a specified Windows Package Manager REST source to fetch all packages or a specific package by Package Identifier.

Alternatively, the `Get-WinGetManifest` PowerShell cmdlet supports targeting a specific `*.json` file or `*.yaml` files as well as targeting an existing Windows Package Manager REST source. For more information on how to use this cmdlet, use the `Get-Help Get-WinGetManifest -Full` or visit the [Get-WinGetManifest article in the PowerShell docs](PowerShell/Get-WinGetManifest.md).

The PowerShell Module must be re-imported each time the PowerShell window is closed. To get a Package Manifest open the Administrative PowerShell Window and run the following:

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Get-WinGetManifest -FunctionName "contoso" -PackageIdentifier "Windows.PowerToys"
```

## Remove manifests from a REST source

The Windows Package Manager REST source provides a location for hosting your Package Manifests. The `Microsoft.WinGet.Source` PowerShell module provides the [Remove-WinGetManifest](PowerShell/Remove-WinGetManifest.md) cmdlet that will remove a specific Package Manifest from the specified Windows Package Manager REST source.

The `Remove-WinGetManifest` PowerShell cmdlet supports targeting an existing Windows Package Manager REST source for a specific Package Identifier. For more information on how to use this cmdlet, use the `Get-Help Remove-WinGetManifest -Full` or visit the [Remove-WinGetManifest article in the PowerShell docs](PowerShell/Remove-WinGetManifest.md).

The PowerShell Module must be re-imported each time the PowerShell window is closed. To remove a Package Manifest open the Administrative PowerShell Window and run the following:

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Remove-WinGetManifest -FunctionName "contoso" -PackageIdentifier "Windows.PowerToys"
```

## Manage Windows Package Manager REST source manually

The following instructions assumes the following Azure objects are named as follows:

| Azure Resource          | Value                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
